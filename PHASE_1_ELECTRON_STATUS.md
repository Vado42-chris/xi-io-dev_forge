## ⏳ REMAINING TASKS

### 1. TypeScript Compilation Errors ⏳
**Status:** In Progress

**Issues:**
- Status Manager method signature mismatches
- Notification Service method calls
- Theme Manager method signatures
- System Integration initialization methods
- Component method signatures
- Service method signatures

**Files Affected:**
- `src/services/system-integration.ts`
- `src/app-initializer.ts`
- `src/components/*.ts`
- `src/services/*.ts`

**Action Required:**
- Fix all TypeScript compilation errors
- Ensure all method signatures match interfaces
- Verify all service initializations
- Test compilation after fixes

### 2. Runtime Testing ⏳
**Status:** Pending

**Tasks:**
- Test application launch
- Test file operations
- Test editor functionality
- Test all panels
- Test all services
- Test all systems

### 3. Final Polish ⏳
**Status:** Pending

**Tasks:**
- Code cleanup
- Documentation completion
- Performance optimization
- UI/UX refinements

## 📝 NOTES

### Strengths
- Comprehensive implementation
- All major components in place
- All services implemented
- All systems integrated
- Good architecture

### Areas for Improvement
- TypeScript compilation errors
- Method signature consistency
- Service initialization patterns
- Error handling

### Overall Assessment
**Phase 1 is 90% complete.** All core functionality is implemented, but TypeScript compilation errors need to be resolved before final completion. Once errors are fixed and testing is complete, Phase 1 will be ready for completion.
